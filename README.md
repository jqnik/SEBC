# <center>Services Enablement Boot Camp

This repository holds the course materials for Cloudera's Services
Enablement Boot Camp.

To follow the course and submit lab work, fork this repo (if you
have direct access), then clone your fork to a local machine.  Edit
your clone to add lab work, commit changes, and push to your fork
on GitHub.

You may also receive this repository as a ZIP file, along with
instructions on how to set things up.

You have the option of making your GitHub repo Private or Public.
It does not matter to the course which option you use.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: GitHub lets you upload new files and edit
existing files directly.  Please don't do this. Use your GitHub
repo as a store for your published lab work. Several students have
lost work by making changes against  their GitHub repo in lieu of
keeping a local copy.

Make your instructors Collaborators on your GitHub repo. This
privilege lets them see the repo if it is private. A Collaborator
can also edit files. If we do this, we'll write the changes to
a branch and issue a Pull Request. You can review the PR and decide
how to handle it.

We will use GitHub Issues to track your lab progress. For each
section, we'll ask you to create one Issue and use it to log your
progress. We will also use GitHub Labels to show the state of your
labs (e.g., started, submitted, evaluated) and Milestones to separate
Issues into broad categories.

In a large class, it may take time for an instructor to assist you.
Include in your current Issue any information that helps define the
problem or question you have. This could include copying an error
message or stack trace to the Issue dialog, or capturing a screen
that is confusing. This way you don't have to keep the details in
mind and can pursue other exercises.

In sum, make the following changes before you start lab work.
* Add your collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Enable `Issues` under `Settings -> Options`. Click the `Features` box and check `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday and Friday of the training week, respectively.
* Click the `Labels` button and change your labels as follows:
    * Leave the `bug` Issue as is
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `submitted`
    * Change `help wanted` to `evaluated`
    * Leave the `invalid` Issue as is
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to yellow (`#fbca04`).
    * Leave the `question` Issue as is
